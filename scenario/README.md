# Scenario

What is your book about? In a content outline, you can create a skeleton of your fiction book, so you don't run into problems later.

Content outline may be a part of the book proposal, instead and/or together with sample chapters. Or it may be a part of the media kit, distributed at book fairs and conventions in order to promote your published book.
