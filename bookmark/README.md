# Bookmark

Bookmarks are a useful tool not only for keeping track of your reading progress but also for promotion! Having an image of the book, combined with a memorable quote and a convenient link to buy the book can go a long way.

Bookmarks are often distributed as a promotional item at book fairs, conventions, or even family reunions :).
