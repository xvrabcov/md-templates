# Book Facts

Also known as the fact sheet, book facts will give the readers information about the book you are hoping they'll buy. How much is it? What genre is ? How big is it? Will it fit on my shelf? All of these questions and so much more can be answered here. (Maybe not the fitting on the shelf question, since not all book shelves subscribe to the uniform bookshelf units.)

This document is often a part of the media kit, distributed on book fairs and conventions in order to promote your published book.
