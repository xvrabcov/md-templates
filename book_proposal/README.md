# Book Proposal

So... you have an idea that you would like to publish. But first, you need to catch an eye of a publisher with your idea, and they generally don't like to buy a pig in a poke. That's where book proposal comes in. In here, you can put all of your arguments as to why your book *deserves* to be published, such as:
- audience analysis (who will buy the book)
- business plan (how shall you go about creating and publishing the book)
- analysis of comparable titles (if *X* sold well why shouldn't my *Y*?)
- sample chapters
- many more

This document is generally the first step into writing a book, following the birth of an idea.
