# An Example of Appendix {.tasklists .hideSectionFromToC}

Supplementary materials for the book that are too long to be kept within a chapter are often *appended* (heh) to the end of the book as the appendix.

## Section One

The appendix may contain many sections.

## Section Two

Which poses a problem.

## Section Three

How to prevent the table of content (ToC) from being overcrowded by these sections?

## Section Four

This can be achieved by the `hideSectionFromToC` snippet which hides the sections from the ToC.

## Hiding Sections

- [ ] Sections hidden from the ToC
    - [x] Opened the relevant chapter file in a text editor
    - [/] Found the chapter title
    - [ ] Added `.hideSectionFromToC` to options in the curly brackets
